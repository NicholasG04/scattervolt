Work In Progress for v2 - Cleaning up some of the code and changing from php -> html

Be sure to have notifications on for #website-updates


## When v2 is released, this is what the branches will mean:

*live = The live webpage. This is currently in use on the site
*master = Upcoming version; bug fixes only
*future = New features, large changes, stuff that doesn't belong in master as a "minor fix"
*v#.# = Archives of previous releases (cloned from live for each version)

## Cycle

1. A Version is released (eg v2)
2. This version is then cloned into a branch with the version name (eg v2)
3. Future is cloned into master to be worked on for the next version (eg v3)
4. master (v3) is worked on
5. master cloned into a release and archived
6. Cycle repeats

## If hotfix necessary

1. live is edited, and then will be released as a -hotfix

Work In Progress for v2 - Cleaning up some of the code and changing from php -> html

Be sure to have notifications on for #website-updates


## When v2 is released, this is what the branches will mean:

live = live on website, now.
master = What's being worked on for the next release
future = What's happening for future releases after next release
vx.y = Previous releases

## Cycle

1. A Version is released (eg v2)
2. This version is then cloned into a branch with the version name (eg v2)
3. Future is cloned into master to be worked on for the next version (eg v3)
4. master (v3) is worked on
5. master cloned into a release and archived
6. Cycle repeats

## If hotfix necessary

1. live is edited, and then will be released as a -hotfix

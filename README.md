Work In Progress for v2 - Cleaning up some of the code and changing from php -> html

Be sure to have notifications on for #website-updates


## When v2 is released, this is what the branches will mean:

live = The live webpage. This is currently in use on the site
master = Upcoming version; bug fixes only
future = New features, large changes, stuff that doesn't belong in master as a "minor fix"
v#.# = Archives of previous releases (cloned from live for each version)

## Cycle

1: Version is released (eg v2)

2: Live is cloned into an archive, ie v-1

3: Master is cloned to live (actually fields the new version)

4: Future is imported into master

5: Master is worked on

6 goto 1

## If hotfix necessary

1. Bug is fixed in live

2: Release is made

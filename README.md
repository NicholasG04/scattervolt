Work In Progress for v2 - Cleaning up some of the code and changing from php -> html

Be sure to have notifications on for #website-updates


## When v2 is released, this is what the branches will mean:

live = The live webpage. This is currently in use on the site

master = Upcoming version; bug fixes only

future = New features, large changes, stuff that doesn't belong in master as a "minor fix"

v#.# = Archives of previous releases (cloned from live for each version)

## Cycle

1: Version is released (eg v2)

2: Live is cloned into an archive, ie v-1

3: Master is cloned to live (actually fields the new version)

4: Future is imported into master

5: Master is worked on

6: Goto 1

## If a hotfix is necessary

1: Bug is fixed in live

2: Hotfix is included as part of next archived release
